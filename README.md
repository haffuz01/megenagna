## Megenagna
Megenagna is a simple program written in C++ that matches two people - currently made with campus students in mind - based on their hobbies, interest and personality.
The program asks users for inputs such as their name, department, hobbies and more then matches them to the most compatible person found in the database. I have currently inserted 10 sample users for trying the algorithm.

## Requirements
To run the program, you'll need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system. The program has been tested on Windows and Linux systems using the following compilers:

Visual Studio on Windows and linux
Codeblocks
GCC on Linux

## Usage
To use the program, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository or download the realmain.cpp file to your local machine.
- Compile the realmain.cpp file using your preferred C++ compiler.
- Run the executable file to start the program.

Once the program starts, you can use the options on screen tp input your credentials, search for your match or try your luck by choosing random :]
